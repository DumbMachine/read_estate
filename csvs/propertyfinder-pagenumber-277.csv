One of the highest residential towers in Downtown Dubai, Grande offers 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom apartments, a not-to-miss investment opportunity given the high demand for property in Downtown Dubai. Sweeping vistas of Burj Khalifa and Dubai’s world-beating landmarks are only the beginning of a true grandiose lifestyle at Grande. Imagine waking up to ‘front-row’ views of the dancing Dubai Fountains. Or having uninterrupted views of the glistening Arabian Gulf from the vertiginous 78th floor. \nGrande sits at the epicentre of The Opera District, a cultural and lifestyle hub brimming with luxury hotels, parks and promenades. The iconic tower rises proudly alongside Dubai Opera, a radiant 2000-seat multi-format performing arts theatre styled on the classic wooden dhows.\nThe living room space is adorned with floor-to-ceiling windows to maximise the spellbinding vistas. Splashes of pine green and dark wood add gravitas to the ethereal living space.\nThe Grande kitchen is proof that style and practicality can coexist. Floor-to-ceiling windows and all-white countertops ensure an abundance of natural light. Bronze accents and marble backsplash perfectly complement the outside glamour.\nThe master bedroom combines mesmerising views of Downtown Dubai with a relaxing space in which to escape the bustle of the outside world. Crisp, clean lines frame a homely setting that is the last word in contemporary luxury.\nAfter a day of high entertainment at The Opera District, change your tune to one of revitalising serenity in your sleek, beautifully conceived bathroom. Classic lines, superior finishing and a calming colour scheme imbue a sense of order and well-being.']"
